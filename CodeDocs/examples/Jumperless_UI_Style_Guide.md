# Jumperless UI Style Guide

This document defines the visual style standards for all user-facing interface elements in the Jumperless project.

## Box Drawing Characters

### Standard Box Style
Always use **single-line rounded corners** for all boxes and frames:

```
╭───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│                                                                           │
╰───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
```

**Never use double-line boxes:**
```
╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗  ❌ DON'T
║                            WRONG STYLE                                    ║  ❌ DON'T  
╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝  ❌ DON'T
```

### Box Character Set
- `╭` - Top-left rounded corner
- `╮` - Top-right rounded corner
- `╰` - Bottom-left rounded corner
- `╯` - Bottom-right rounded corner
- `│` - Vertical line
- `─` - Horizontal line
- `╌` - Light horizontal separator (for dividers within content)

### Box Alignment
- Always ensure content is properly centered with consistent padding
- Count characters carefully to maintain alignment
- Use consistent width (75 characters is standard for main headers)

## Unicode Characters and Emojis

### No Standard Emojis
Replace all standard emojis with monochrome appropriate unicode alternatives:
Don't add emojis or unicode to existing code unless absolutely necessary.

Don't add unicode characters for normal prompts, only use them extremely sparingly or in some visual UI situation

### Color Usage
- Always use ANSI terminal colors to provide meaning and visual distinction
- Prefer colors that work well on both dark and light terminal backgrounds
- Use color consistently across all interfaces
- Colors should reinforce the semantic meaning of symbols

## General Design Principles

### Consistency
- Use the same symbols for the same concepts throughout the entire codebase
- Maintain consistent spacing and alignment
- Apply the same color schemes across different modules

### Accessibility  
- Choose unicode characters that display well in terminal environments
- Ensure sufficient contrast between foreground and background colors
- Prefer ancient/historical unicode symbols over modern emoji
- Use geometric shapes and mathematical symbols when appropriate
- Choose symbols that are culturally neutral and universally understandable

## Implementation Notes

### Terminal Compatibility
- All symbols must render properly in standard terminal emulators
- Test on both Windows, macOS, and Linux terminals
- Consider fallback options for terminals with limited unicode support

### Performance
- Avoid excessive use of ANSI escape sequences
- Cache color calculations where possible
- Use efficient string building for complex displays

### Code Organization
- Define symbol constants in a central header file
- Create utility functions for common display patterns
- Keep style decisions consistent across all modules

## Examples

### Good File Manager Display

### Good Status Messages
```
File saved successfully
Error: Cannot save file  
Native jumperless module not available
Starting eKilo editor...
```

This style guide should be followed for all user-facing interface elements to maintain a cohesive and professional appearance throughout the Jumperless project.

## Testing Symbol Compatibility

To test which Unicode symbols render correctly on your system, run the included test script:

```bash
python examples/quick_symbol_test.py
```

This script will test all symbols defined in this guide and report which ones render properly on your terminal/system.

## Extended Symbol Library

The following symbols are approved for use in future Jumperless UI development. When adding new functionality, choose symbols from this curated collection to maintain consistency and ensure compatibility.

// __atomic_test_and_set for the RP2040 (OG Jumperless).
//
// The cortex-m0plus has no native atomic (LDREX/STREX) instructions, so GCC
// lowers __atomic_test_and_set (used by the cross-core ADC lock in
// Peripherals.cpp readAdc() and by LogicAnalyzer) to a libcall. This
// bare-metal toolchain ships no libatomic and libgcc for this multilib does
// not provide __atomic_test_and_set, so we provide it here. The M33-based V5
// inlines the instruction and never references the symbol, so this file is a
// no-op in the V5 build.
//
// Correctness: the ADC lock is contended BETWEEN THE TWO CORES, so masking
// interrupts is not enough - we use an RP2040 hardware spinlock to make the
// byte test-and-set genuinely atomic across cores.
//
// We use a FIXED spinlock instance (PICO_SPINLOCK_ID_OS1) rather than claiming
// one in a global constructor. A constructor that ran before the SDK was ready
// (or that panicked out of spin_lock_claim_unused) would hang the board before
// USB ever enumerates - exactly the kind of silent early-boot failure we must
// avoid. RP2040 hardware spinlocks are just SIO registers, reset at boot by the
// SDK runtime init, so a fixed instance is safe to use directly without the
// hw_claim bookkeeping. OS1 is reserved for OS/user use and we are its only
// user here.
//
// ponytail: one fixed spinlock guards every __atomic_test_and_set call. Fine
// for the ADC lock / LA setup (negligible contention); if a future hot path
// needs lock-free byte TAS, upgrade to GCC-libatomic-style pointer-hashed
// spinlock striping.
